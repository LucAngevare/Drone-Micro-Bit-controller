# DJI Tello Micro:Bit controller

Yeah I don't know why I even bothered writing a README.md file for this honestly

## Description

For computer science we were told to just do whatever with a micro:bit, the micro:bit was a damn pain in the backside to work with, for all the same reasons as other things made/owned by Microsoft. The radio channels were totally not configurable, so I was unable to communicate with the drone directly with the micro:bit via WiFi (which theoretically works via 2,4GHz up to 5GHz). The thing had Bluetooth that was only able to communicate with other micro:bits or mobile (you can pair with the thing via laptop but connecting to it is very much a different question) so I couldn't connect with the Bluetooth. I was left with the only option of connecting my Raspberry Pi to the Micro:Bit with USB so I can have communication via serial.
